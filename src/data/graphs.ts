        description: `Given a reference of a node in a **[connected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectivity_(graph_theory)#Connected_graph)** undirected graph.

Return a **[deep copy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_copying#Deep_copy)** (clone) of the graph.

Each node in the graph contains a value (\`int\`) and a list (\`List[Node]\`) of its neighbors.

\`\`\`text
class Node {
    public int val;
    public List<Node> neighbors;

\`\`\`

**Test case format:**

For simplicity, each node's value is the same as the node's index (1-indexed). For example, the first node with \`val == 1\`, the second node with \`val == 2\`, and so on. The graph is represented in the test case using an adjacency list.

**An adjacency list** is a collection of unordered lists used to represent a finite graph. Each list describes the set of neighbors of a node in the graph.

The given node will always be the first node with \`val = 1\`. You must return the **copy of the given node** as a reference to the cloned graph.

\`\`\`text

- It is adjacent to an 'O' that should not be flipped.
The bottom 'O' is on the border, so it is not flipped.
